# yolo-chrome-mcp

Expose every open Chrome tab to an MCP server so AIs can browse, debug, and operate them — using your **already-logged-in** Chrome session.

- 17 tools spanning tab discovery, screenshots, accessibility-tree interactables, console/network/storage, click/type/scroll/navigate, JS eval.
- Staged tool design + filtered defaults keep AI context tight (see [docs/FEATURE_PLAN.md](docs/FEATURE_PLAN.md)).
- An in-tab safety overlay confirms destructive actions (form submits, money-ish labels, cross-origin nav, risky `evalJs`).

## Install

You need both halves: the MCP server (driven by Claude) and the Chrome extension (loaded once into your Chrome).

### Option A0 — Chrome Web Store + one-liner (when the listing is live)

If you installed the extension from the Chrome Web Store, you still need the
local MCP server. Run this once (the extension popup shows the same command
with a "Copy" button when its status dot is red):

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user yolo-chrome -- npx -y yolo-chrome-mcp@latest \
  && npx -y yolo-chrome-mcp@latest install --routing-only
```

This registers the server with Claude Code and installs the PreToolUse hook +
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` rule. Restart Claude Code and the popup turns green.

### Option A — Claude Code (npx, recommended)

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user yolo-chrome -- npx -y yolo-chrome-mcp@latest
npx yolo-chrome-mcp install        # extension load + routing hook + CLAUDE.md rule
```

**Important**: pass `--scope user`. Without it the server is registered only for the directory you ran the command from, and Claude in other projects will report "Failed to connect".

The `install` step does three things, with prompts:

1. **Extension load** — opens `chrome://extensions` and copies the extension folder path to your clipboard. In the file dialog: `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+G` → `Cmd/Ctrl+V` → Select.
2. **PreToolUse hook** (recommended) — writes `~/.yolo-chrome-mcp/browser-routing-hook.sh` and registers it in `~/.claude/settings.json` matching `mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__.*|mcp__Control_Chrome__.*`. When Claude tries to use a competing browser tool, the hook blocks and tells Claude to use `mcp__yolo-chrome__*` instead.
3. **CLAUDE.md routing rule** (recommended) — appends a `## Browser routing (yolo-chrome-mcp)` section to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` so Claude has a persistent reason in plain language.

Re-running `install` is idempotent. To remove the hook + rule later: `npx yolo-chrome-mcp uninstall-routing`.

### Option B — Claude Desktop (MCPB one-click)

1. Download the latest `yolo-chrome-mcp-*.mcpb` from [Releases](https://github.com/rikutoe/yolo-chrome-mcp/releases).
2. Drag it onto Claude Desktop.
3. Inside the bundle there is an `extension/` folder — load it as an unpacked extension at `chrome://extensions`.

### Option C — Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rikutoe/yolo-chrome-mcp
cd yolo-chrome-mcp
npm install
npm run build
claude mcp add yolo-chrome -- node $(pwd)/server/dist/index.js
# Then load extension/dist via chrome://extensions → Load unpacked
```

## How it works

```
Claude ⇄ stdio ⇄ MCP server (Node)  ⇄ ws://127.0.0.1:8765 ⇄ Chrome extension (MV3)
                                                              └── chrome.debugger (CDP) → tab
```

The Chrome extension stays alive in your real Chrome profile. The MCP server is spawned per-Claude-session and connects locally over WebSocket — nothing leaves your machine.

## Tools

| Tool | Stage | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `listTabs` | 1 | All open tabs |
| `getTabInfo` | 1 | One tab's metadata |
| `screenshot` | 2 | Viewport screenshot (fullPage opt-in) |
| `getPageText` | 2 | Visible text, paginated |
| `getInteractables` | 3 | Clickable elements via a11y tree |
| `getConsoleLogs` | 4 | Filtered console buffer |
| `getNetworkActivity` | 4 | Filtered network summary |
| `getNetworkRequest` | 4 | One request, full details |
| `getStorage` | 4 | cookie / localStorage / sessionStorage |
| `getSourceAt` | 5 | JS source ±N lines |
| `click` / `type` / `scroll` | — | UI actions by stableId |
| `navigate` | — | Same-tab navigation |
| `evalJs` | — | Last-resort JS eval |
| `waitForStable` | — | Wait for network-idle |
| `setSafetyMode` | — | `always` / `dangerous-only` / `off` |

## Safety overlay

In `dangerous-only` mode (default) the extension shows a yellow confirmation banner in the tab whenever the AI tries to:

- Click an element labelled `submit` / `delete` / `送信` / `削除`, or a `type=submit` input, or text matching a money-ish pattern (`¥`, `$`, etc.)
- Navigate across origins
- Run `evalJs` that touches cookies, network, or storage
- Type something that looks like a credit-card number

Switch modes from the popup or via the `setSafetyMode` tool.

## Distribution / Release

Tag and push:

```bash
git tag v0.2.0 && git push origin v0.2.0
```

The release workflow builds, publishes to npm with provenance, and attaches `*.mcpb` and `extension.zip` to the GitHub release.

Required repo secret: `NPM_TOKEN`.
